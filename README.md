## Crypto Clustering Analysis
Combining our financial Python programmign skills to with new unsupervised learning skills to plot data Cryptocurrency data provided.

## Technologies

The project leverages python 3.7 with the following packages:

* [python](https://www.python.org/) - Python is a programming language that lets you work more quickly and integrate your systems more effectively.

* [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) - pandas is a Python package that provides fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with "relational" or "labeled" data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis / manipulation tool available in any language. It is already well on its way towards this goal.

* [Sklearn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) - scikit-learn is a Python module for machine learning built on top of SciPy and is distributed under the 3-Clause BSD license.

* [KMeans](https://github.com/bugra/kmeans) - kmeans is BSD licensed fast k-means implementation(with better initialization, known as k-means++) written in Go. It supports various distance functions out of the box for convenience and experimentation. It has large coverage for tests. The algorithm is tested on Iris dataset and distance functions have full test coverage.

* [PCA](https://github.com/gbuesing/pca) - PCA can be used to map data to a lower dimensional space while minimizing information loss. It's useful for data visualization, where you're limited to 2-D and 3-D plots.
